Redesign the website layout to be truly mobile-first while preserving the existing luxury fragrance brand aesthetic.

Primary goal:
Make the mobile experience compact, swipe-intuitive, and premium, without affecting desktop layout.

1) Horizontal Swipe Sections (Fragments, Why Amary, Reviews)
- On mobile, convert these sections into horizontal swipeable rows.
- Each card should be slightly smaller than full width.
- The next card must be partially visible (about 15–30%) to clearly indicate swipe interaction.
- Enable smooth horizontal scrolling with snap alignment.
- No arrows, no dots, no UI indicators — the partial card visibility itself signals swipability.
- Cards should feel light, refined, and touch-friendly.

2) Swipe Feel & Premium Motion
- Add subtle horizontal swipe inertia so movement feels natural and fluid.
- No aggressive animations or bounce effects.
- Motion should feel calm, editorial, and intentional.

3) Image Scaling for Mobile
- Reduce the size of large images (Rooted in Heritage, Essence over Excess) specifically for mobile.
- Images should support the text, not dominate the screen.
- Maintain clean spacing and proportion.
- No cropping that harms composition.

4) “Connect with Amari” Section
- Redesign this section for mobile as a compact, square or near-square card layout.
- Ensure it feels balanced, centered, and visually calm.
- Avoid tall or stretched layouts that feel heavy on mobile.

5) Global Mobile Refinements
- Slightly reduce font sizes where they feel oversized on mobile.
- Reduce vertical padding and margins to avoid excessive scrolling.
- Keep touch targets comfortable but not oversized.
- Maintain hierarchy and readability.

Rules:
- Do NOT change desktop layout.
- Do NOT change brand colors, fonts, or written content.
- Do NOT add new sections or remove existing ones.
- Do NOT add flashy UI or decorative elements.

The final mobile experience should feel:
- Intentionally designed for mobile
- Premium and modern
- Effortless to swipe
- Calm, elegant, and fragrance-brand appropriate
